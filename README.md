# 🏥 Hospital Management & Analytics System using SQL

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a relational **SQL database** designed to **manage and analyze hospital operations**, enabling **data-driven insights** into:
- Medical expenses
- Patient demographics
- Hospital performance across departments and geographic locations

It was built as a part of a data analytics initiative to solve real-world problems in **healthcare management**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design and implement a **structured SQL schema** for hospital data
- Import and clean **real-world-style data** from CSV files
- Write complex **analytical queries** to extract insights from the dataset
- Generate reports at **hospital**, **city**, and **monthly** levels

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📊 Analysis of **admissions, staffing, and expenses**
- 🏨 Department-wise and city-wise **hospital performance metrics**
- 📅 Use of **date functions** to derive monthly insights
- 🧼 Realistic **data cleaning and preprocessing** with CSVs
- 📁 Organized schema with **normalized tables** for better scalability
